"""
A production facility needs an iterable object to keep track product assembly times.
A class called "KeyboardProductionTimes" that will store the information needs to be created.
Each keyboard will have a string serial number "KBXXXXXX" and timedelta for production time
Iterating objects created with KeyboardProductionTimes will return all keyboards that had production
time greater than 2000s
1) 40p: Definition
    a) 10p: Basic class structure of KeyboardProductionTimes
    b) 10p: Basic class structure of iterator
    c) 10p: Method to add produced keyboards with serial, production start and production stop
    d) 10p: Method that returns average keyboard production time
2) 40p: Execution:
    a) 10p: Create instance of KeyboardProductionTimes
    b) 10p: Call method to add keyboard <add_keyboard(serial, start_time, end_time>)>
        - KB023871, datetime(any) datetime(any)
        - KB023873, datetime(any) datetime(any)
        - KB023875, datetime(any) datetime(any)
    c) 10p: Call method to return average production time <average_production_time()>
    d) 10p: Iterate the created object and write each keyboard serial with production
            time greater then 2000s in a file on a new line
3) 20p: Documenting:
   a) 5p: type hints for arguments
